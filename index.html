<h3>Ravva dosa, also known as semolina dosa or sooji dosa, is a popular South Indian dish. It is a type of crepe made from a batter consisting of semolina (ravva or sooji), rice flour, and all-purpose flour. The batter is typically fermented for a few hours or overnight, which gives the dosa a slightly tangy flavor.
